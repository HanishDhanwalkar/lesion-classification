# lesion-classification

- two-stage model to detect oral lesions with a detector network and classify the detected region into 6 types with a second-stage classifier network

### Methods
- pretrained ViT, eg. gemini-1.5-flash
- Few-Shot Learning (on pretrained ViTs)

TODO:
1. Few-shot prompting
1. Calculate confusion metric on predictions by gemini
1. IoU for segmentation given by ViT
